## RSSchool final task

### Deploy: https://tatisap.github.io/rs-lang/  
### Backend repo: https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/react-rslang-be  
### Backend deploy (heroku): https://rslang-backend.herokuapp.com/

### Stack used:
- ***TypeScript***  
Writing code in TypeScript undoubtedly took more time and required additional setup, though, it proveded with features not present in JavaScript and made the code well-typed: all the necessary custom types and interfaces were thought out, which made the code more understandable and helped to avoid possible errors or unexpected behaviour that could have arosen due to the use of the wrong type (not the one that was assumed);
- ***Sass***  
Sass contains many features that are not present in CSS. It helped us shorten the code, reduce its duplication and speed up writing, which eventually saved a lot of our time. Moreover, it is fully compatible with all versions of CSS;
- ***Chart.js***  
It took some time to learn how to work with this library, but its use significantly saved time for vizualizing elements for statistics and made it possible to devote more time directly to the logic of generating and obtaining necessary statistics data;
- ***Webpack***  
Webpack helped us in splitting our code into different modules and when everything was ready - put them and their dependencies together and threw a new file with everything merged and ready for the web. Its other good feature is that it minimized the code in the resulting file and reduced its size without changing the functionality. And although it was necessary to set up configuration, in Webpack this step is easily done since it is well-described and quite intuitive;
- ***Eslint & Prettier***  
They let us maintain the quality of the code throughout the entire development process: the main goal of Eslint was to find existing errors in the code and help to avoid possible ones, while the Prettier one - to bring the code to a uniform formatting. It was also very convenient that most of the rules and settings are flexible - they can not only be disabled, but configured to suit the needs or a specific case;
- ***Git & GitHub***  
Git is a great version control system that helped us to develop the product by producing increments. It was easily integrated with a development environment we used - Visual Studio Code. Conflicts were displayed nicely so we could resolve them with ease.  
Whereas GitHub affords many other development-friendly tools, such as convenient code review system and a project board that we used for monitoring the progress of tasks. Seeing the number of Pull Requests merged, Issues closed, and so on also gave us great insights on the project progress.
